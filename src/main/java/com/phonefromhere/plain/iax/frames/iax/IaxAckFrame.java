 6.9.1.  ACK: Acknowledgement Message

 An ACK acknowledges the receipt of an IAX message.  An ACK is sent
 upon receipt of a Full Frame that does not have any other protocol-
 defined response.  An ACK MUST have both a source call number and
 destination call number.  It MUST also not change the sequence number
 counters, and MUST return the same time-stamp it received.  This
 time-stamp allows the originating peer to determine to which message
 the ACK is responding.  Receipt of an ACK requires no action.

 An ACK MAY also be sent as an initial acknowledgment of an IAX
 message that requires some other protocol-defined message
 acknowledgment, as long as the required message is also sent within
 some peer-defined amount of time.  This allows the acknowledging peer
 to delay transmission of the proper IAX message, which may add
 security against brute-force password attacks during authentication
 exchanges.

 When the following messages are received, an ACK MUST be sent in
 return: NEW, HANGUP, REJECT, ACCEPT, PONG, AUTHREP, REGREL, REGACK,
 REGREJ, TXREL.  ACKs SHOULD not be expected by any peer and their
 purpose is purely to force the transport layer to be up to date.

 The ACK message does not requires any IEs.
