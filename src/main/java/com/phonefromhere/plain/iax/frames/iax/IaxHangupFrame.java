 6.2.5.  HANGUP Request Message

 A HANGUP message is sent by either peer and indicates a call tear-
 down.  It MAY include the 'causecode' and 'cause' IEs to indicate the
 reason for terminating the call.  Upon receipt of a HANGUP message,
 an IAX peer MUST immediately respond with an ACK, and then destroy
 the call leg at its end.  After a HANGUP message has been received
 for a call leg, any messages received that reference that call leg
 (i.e., have the same source/destination call identifiers) MUST be
 answered with an INVAL message.  This indicates that the received
 message is invalid because the call no longer exists.

 After sending a HANGUP message, the sender MUST destroy the call and
 respond to subsequent messages regarding this call with an INVAL
 message.
