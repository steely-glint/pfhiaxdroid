 8.4.  IAX Frames

 Frames of type 'IAX' are used to provide management of IAX endpoints.
 They handle IAX signalling (e.g., call setup, maintenance, and tear-
 down).  They MAY also handle direct transmission of media data, but
 this is not optimal for VoIP calls.  They do not carry session-
 specific control (e.g., device state), as this is the purpose of
 Control Frames.  The IAX commands are listed and described below.
